### Azure_Project_IncrementalLoad

## Project Overview:

The Azure-Project_IncrementalLoad demonstrates the implementation of an end-to-end data engineering pipeline on the Azure platform. The project focuses on extracting raw data from an external source, transforming it incrementally, and loading it into a well-structured data warehouse using Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

## Key Features:

**Incremental Data Loading:** Efficient loading of only new or modified data from the external source into the Azure SQL Database using Azure Data Factory.\
**Data Lake Storage:** Implementation of a multi-layered storage architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold containers) in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for better data management and performance.\
**Data Transformation:** Usage of Azure Databricks for data cleaning, transformation, and the application of business logic.\
**Star Schema Design:** Building a fact and dimension table schema to structure the data for analytics and reporting.\
**Scalability and Automation:** Fully automated pipeline that scales efficiently for large datasets and is built with a cloud-first approach.\
**Data Quality:** Ensuring data consistency and accuracy by using incremental loading methods and managing the data at each stage with optimized processes.

## Architecture:

**1. Data Extraction:** Data is extracted from a raw CSV file hosted on an external URL using a dynamic pipeline in Azure Data Factory.\

**2. Incremental Load:** The extracted data is loaded into an Azure SQL Database using an incremental load approach, ensuring that only new or updated data is transferred.\

**3. Bronze Layer (Raw Data Storage):** Data is then extracted from the Azure SQL Database and stored in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 in the bronze container in Parquet format.\

**4. Silver Layer (Data Transformation):** Data is transformed in the bronze container and copied to the silver container using Azure Databricks.\

**5. Gold Layer (Data Modeling):** The final stage involves the creation of a star schema (fact and dimension tables) in the gold container within ADLS Gen2. Incremental data loading is applied to ensure up-to-date datasets.

## Technology Stack:

**Azure Data Factory (ADF):** Used for data extraction from external URLs and loading the data into Azure SQL Database. Implements the incremental load strategy.
**Azure SQL Database:** Acts as a staging area where data is temporarily stored before being moved to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
**Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2:** Storage service for large datasets. It is used for organizing data in three layers: Bronze (raw), Silver (transformed), and Gold (modeled).
**Azure Databricks:** Used for data transformation and cleaning in the Silver layer, as well as for the creation of a star schema in the Gold layer.
**Parquet File Format:** The data is stored in Parquet format, an efficient columnar storage format, particularly suited for big data analytics.
**Star Schema:** Used in the Gold layer for data modeling, comprising of fact and dimension tables, enabling efficient querying and reporting.

## Conclusion:

The Azure-Project_IncrementalLoad provides a comprehensive, efficient solution for building an automated, scalable data pipeline on Azure. By combining Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Data Lake Storage Gen2, this project ensures that data is consistently extracted, transformed, and loaded in an optimized manner, adhering to best practices in data engineering. The implementation of an incremental loading strategy reduces data redundancy and ensures minimal resource consumption, while the use of a star schema in the Gold layer enhances the performance and scalability of reporting and analytics.
